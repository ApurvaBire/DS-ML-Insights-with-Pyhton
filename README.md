ü§ñ Machine Learning Algorithms Used

This repository implements essential supervised learning algorithms using Python and scikit-learn. Below is a brief overview of each:

üîπ Simple Linear Regression

A regression technique used to model the relationship between a single independent variable and a continuous dependent variable by fitting a straight line.

üîπ Logistic Regression

A classification algorithm used to predict binary outcomes (e.g., Yes/No, 0/1) based on input variables. It outputs probabilities and uses the sigmoid function.

üîπ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

A distance-based classification algorithm that assigns a label based on the majority class among the 'k' closest data points in the training set.

üîπ Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes. It works well with high-dimensional data and can handle non-linear boundaries using kernels.


This repository contains modular and well-documented Jupyter Notebooks that walk through the complete data science workflow from data acquisition to model building. Each notebook includes examples, explanations, and visual outputs.
