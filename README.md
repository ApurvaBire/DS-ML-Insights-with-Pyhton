# DS-ML-Insights-with-Pyhton

üìä Data Science & Machine Learning with Python
A structured and practical repository to learn and apply core data science concepts and machine learning algorithms using the Python programming language.A comprehensive collection of data science fundamentals with Python, covering data acquisition, manipulation, and machine learning algorithms.
This repository contains modular and well-documented Jupyter Notebooks that walk through the complete data science workflow  from data acquisition to model building. Each notebook includes examples, explanations, and visual outputs.

‚ñ™Ô∏è Tools & Environment - 
Python 3.x: As the programming language for data science and machine learning tasks.
Anaconda IDE: For managing packages, environments, and providing a user-friendly interface for data science tasks.
Jupyter Notebook	Interactive environment for code, output, and documentation.

To get started, install Anaconda and launch Jupyter Notebook from the Navigator or terminal.

‚ñ™Ô∏è Libraries Used - 
numpy -	Array creation, mathematical and numerical operations
pandas -	Data loading, wrangling, and preprocessing
matplotlib - Basic visualizations (line plots, bar charts, etc.)
seaborn	- Advanced visualizations and statistical plotting
